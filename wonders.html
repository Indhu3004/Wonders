<h2 style="font-size:20px;"> 1. Christ the Redeemer, Brazil </h2>
<p style="font-size:20px;"> Christ the Redeemer is a 125 feet tall statue designed by Heitor da Silva Costa, sculpted by French sculptor Paul Landowski. Since the statue is atop a mountain, it's prone to getting hit by lightning—in fact it gets hit around three to six times a year. Prior to the FIFA World Cup in 2014, a lightning struck and broke one of the statue's thumbs. Also, this structure wasn't originally built in Brazil; it was made in France.

<h3 style="font-size:20px;"> 2.Petra, Jordan </h3>
<p style="font-size:20px;">
A man made marvel, Petra is known as the Rose City, built out of pink sandstones. This structure, in fact is evidence that the Middle East was the most influential region of the world in the Middle Ages. But this place wasn't given its due for a long time—did you know that Bedouin of the Arabian Desert destroyed some of the most priceless carvings on the Treasury's walls? They used the carvings as target during their shooting practice.

<br>
<h4 style="font-size:20px;"> 3.Machu Picchu, Peru </h4>
<p style="font-size:20px;"> One of the most famous lost cities of the world, Machu Picchu, also known as the Lost City of the Incas, was built in 1450 and abandoned a hundred years after that. Declared as a UNESCO Heritage Site in 1983, the structure is built completely out of dry-stone walls. Many of the stones that were used to build the city were more than 50 pounds in weight, but it is said that no wheels were used to transport these rocks up the mountain. In fact it is alleged that hundreds of men pushed the heavy rocks up the steep mountain side.

<br>
<h5 style="font-size:20px;"> 4.Colosseum, Italy</h5>
<p style="font-size:20px;">
Built between 70 AD and 82 AD by Emperor Titus Vespasian, the Colosseum in Rome is the most iconic, ancient amphitheatre in the world. Seating over 50,000 spectators, the amphitheatre was built for public spectacles like the infamous gladiator fights, animal hunts, executions, and dramas. It is said that the events that took place at the Colosseum were graphic and brutal—during certain games around 10,000 animals would be killed in a single day.

<br>
<h6 style="font-size:20px;"> 5.Chichen Itza, Mexico </h6>
<p style="font-size:20px;">
Chichen Itza translates to “At the mouth of the well of Itza”. Believed to be the largest Mayan city ever built, the centre of the Chichen Itza comprises El Castillo, also known as the Temple of Kukulcan. Many travellers aver that the sites in Chichen Itza are known for their unusual sounds. If you clap once from one end of the Ball Court, it reverberates and creates nine echoes in the middle of the court. A clap in front of the Kukulkan Pyramid creates an echo resembling the serpent's chirp.

<br>
<h7 style="font-size:20px;"> 6.Taj Mahal, India </h7>
<p style="font-size:20px;">
One of the most glorious displays of love in history is the Taj Mahal, built by emperor Shah Jahan in honour of his late wife. One of the most popular legends about the structure is that the emperor had every workers hands cut off so so they couldn't recreate the design. About 1000 elephants were used to transport construction material to the site.
</p>
<br>
<h8 style="font-size:20px;"> 7.Great Wall of China </h8>
<p style="font-size:20px;">
The original wall built under the rule of Emperor Qin Shi Huang of the Win Dynasty took around 20 years to finish. 21,196 kilometres long, the Great Wall witnesses highlands, landscapes, plateaus, natural barriers and more. While it is an architectural marvel alright, did you know that this structure is also considered the longest cemetery on Earth? Over a million people died building it and archaeologists have found human remains buried under parts of the wall. Creepy much?
